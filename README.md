Project Overview

This project involves the development and deployment of my personal portfolio website using various Azure services to ensure a reliable and efficient hosting environment.
Here's an overview of the Azure services I utilized for this project:

1. Azure Static Web App
I chose Azure Static Web App as the foundation for hosting my portfolio website. This service simplifies the deployment process by connecting directly to my GitHub repository.
Whenever I push changes to my repository, Azure Static Web App automatically builds and deploys the updated website, ensuring seamless updates for my visitors.

3. Azure Storage Account
To efficiently manage and store the code and assets of my portfolio website, I set up an Azure Storage Account. This account serves as a secure repository for all the files associated
with my website, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media content. By using Azure Storage, I can easily access and manage these resources while benefiting from Azure's reliability and scalability.

5. Azure Backup
For safeguarding my website's data and ensuring quick recovery in case of unexpected incidents, I implemented Azure Backup. By creating a Service Vault within Azure Backup,
 I established a robust backup and recovery solution for my website. This ensures that I can restore my website to a previous state if any data loss or issues occur, minimizing downtime and potential data loss.

In conclusion, this project leverages Azure's suite of services to create a secure, scalable, and reliable environment for hosting my personal portfolio website. Azure Static Web App 
streamlines deployment, while Azure Storage Account efficiently manages my code and assets. Azure Backup provides peace of mind by offering data protection and recovery capabilities, 
ensuring the continued availability of my portfolio website.
